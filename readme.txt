Crime Rate Prediction with Machine Learning Models
This project uses various machine learning models to predict crime categories in San Francisco based on historical crime data. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and contains records of crimes, including details such as the crime type, location (latitude and longitude), time, and the police district.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to:

Preprocess the crime data.

Train multiple machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes.

Evaluate the models' performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Visualize crime data using heatmaps with Folium.

Features:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing values.

Feature engineering such as extracting cyclical features from time (hour, day, month).

Label encoding for categorical variables.

Scaling numerical features like latitude, longitude, and year.

Models:

Decision Tree: A simple yet powerful model that learns decision rules.

Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that improves model accuracy.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based algorithm for classification.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.

Visualizations:

Crime Heatmap: Visualizing crime density using Folium and HeatMap.

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each model.

Confusion Matrix for each model's performance.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the SF Crime Rate Prediction dataset from Kaggle. It contains historical records of crimes in San Francisco, including crime category, time, location (latitude and longitude), and more.
